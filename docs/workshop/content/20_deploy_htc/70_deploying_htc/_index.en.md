We are now ready to deploy HTC-Grid using the terraform stack provided by the project. The terraform stack does use `~/environment/aws-htc-grid/generated/grid_config.json` to inject a few variables to the project.

Before we deploy the project, we need to initialize the terraform state. Remember we will be using the `$S3_TFSTATE_HTCGRID_BUCKET_NAME` bucket to hold the state. You can read more about the S3 terraform backend [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html)

```
make init-grid-deployment TAG=$TAG REGION=$HTCGRID_REGION
```

All the dependencies have been created and are now ready. We are now ready to deploy the HTC-Grid project. There is one last thing to note. HTC-Grid deploys a grafana version behind [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). While you can modify and select which passwords to use in cognito, the grafana internal deployment still requires an admin password. Select a memorable password change the value in the placeholder `<my_grafana_admin_password>` below (make this password follows [cognito default policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-policies.html)):

```
make apply-custom-runtime TAG=$TAG REGION=$HTCGRID_REGION GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<my_grafana_admin_password>
```

The execution of this command will prompt for `yes` to continue. Just type yes, for the command to proceed

{{% notice warning %}}
The install operation may take ~20mins. If the `terraform apply` fails with errors related with timeouts, re-run the command until the `terraform apply` step successfully completes.

### Validating HTC-Grid Deployment

If terraform apply is successful then in the terraform folder two files are created:

* **kubeconfig_htc_$TAG**: this file give access to the EKS cluster through kubectl 
* **Agent_config.json**: this file contains all the parameters, so the agent can run in the infrastructure

Let's validate that the Compute Plane has been set up accordingly. First of all, we need to configure our environment with [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) configuration pointing to our cluster. We will also read from the terraform output the Agent config file and prepare our environment to select the configuration on newly created terminals.

  ```
  cd ~/environment/aws-htc-grid/deployment/grid/terraform
  export AGENT_CONFIG_FILE=$(terraform output -raw agent_config)
  echo "export AGENT_CONFIG_FILE=$AGENT_CONFIG_FILE" >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

With this done, we can get the number of nodes in the cluster using the following command:

  ```
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

{{% notice tip %}}
You should have one or more nodes. If not please the review the configuration files and particularly the variable eks_worker
{{% /notice %}}

To check that the HTC-Agent is running on the system, you can run the following command.

  ```
  kubectl get pods
  ```

Finally to check all the deployments are running as expected, 

  ```
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```

{{% notice note %}}
You should have all pods in running state, this might one minute but no more.
